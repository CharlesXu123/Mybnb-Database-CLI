//    A host should be able to update the price of a listing, but only if the listing is
//    available for rent in the specific date range the change is to be made.
//    Otherwise, if the listing is booked the change cannot take place and the host
//    should be informed.

//    A host cannot change the availability of a listing on a date it is booked; that
//    can only happen through a cancellation (the host has to cancel the booking
//    that day). The host can change the availability of a listing on a date it is
//    available (and make it unavailable for rent that date).
