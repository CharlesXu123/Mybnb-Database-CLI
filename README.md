# c43Project

This project is to build a simple command line interface tool that interacts with Mybnb database in mysql. It allows direct access and changes to the database with the proper input. The target users are admins or some backend api, they have root access to the database and can run reports to understand the data.

The project doesn't have a login system to validate the user identity or a complex parser to validate and sanitize user inputs. It does have basic input validation such as checking if the input is a date, it cannot validate if the input address is correct, so users are responsible for what they put in the database.
